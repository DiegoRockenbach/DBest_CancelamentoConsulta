## Subqueries in the `SELECT` Clause  

In SQL, subqueries can appear inside the `SELECT` clause of an outer query.  
This is particularly useful when computing **independent results** from the same pivot table.  

For example, suppose we want to retrieve, for each movie, its **title**, the **number of cast members**, and the **number of crew members**.  
This can be achieved using subqueries inside the `SELECT` clause:  

```sql
SELECT m.title, 
       (SELECT COUNT() FROM movie_cast mc WHERE m.movie_id = mc.movie_id), 
        (SELECT COUNT() FROM movie_crew mc WHERE m.movie_id = mc.movie_id) 
FROM movie m;
```

Alternatively, the **`LATERAL JOIN`** approach can be used to achieve the same result:

```sql
SELECT m.title, agg1.cont, agg2.cont
FROM movie m1
JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS cont FROM movie_cast mc
    WHERE mc.movie_id = m1.movie_id
) AS agg1 
JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS cont FROM movie_crew mc
    WHERE mc.movie_id = m1.movie_id
) AS agg2 
ON agg1.cont = agg2.cont;
```

Other alternatives exist, but some are highly inefficient.
For example, a naive approach would require the movie table to join against movie_cast and then with movie_crew , leading to redundant aggregations caused by the unnecessary join between movie_cast and movie_crew. Both subqueries inside the SELECT clause and LATERAL JOIN help avoid this inefficiency.



In **DBest**, this query is represented by a **tree structure**, where processing starts at the `movie` table.  

### Step-by-step execution:  



## Query Execution Steps  

1. A **nested loop left outer join** is performed between the `movie` and the `movie_cast` tables.  
   - The **outer join** ensures that movies without cast members are included.  

2. A **`GROUP BY`** operation is applied.  

3. This `GROUP BY` operation retains three columns:  
   - **`movie_id`** → The grouping column.  
   - **`title`** → Computed using the `FIRST` aggregation function.  
     - This function takes the first occurrence of the title within the group, but any occurrence would work.  
   - **`cast_count`** → Computed using the `COUNT` aggregation function.  

4. The same process is repeated for the `movie_crew` table:  
   - Another **outer join** is followed by a **`GROUP BY`** operation to compute the crew member count.  

5. The second `GROUP BY` operation retains four columns:  
   - **`movie_id`** → The grouping column.  
   - **`title`** → Retrieved from the previous aggregation using the `FIRST` function. 
   - **`cast_count`** → Retrieved from the previous aggregation using the `FIRST` function.  
   - **`crew_count`** → Computed using the `COUNT` aggregation function.

A **very similar query plan** was used to solve a query that included a **subquery in the `FROM` clause**, as shown in the previous section.  The only distinction is that **no filter is applied** as a final step.  

Subqueries in the `SELECT` clause can often be rewritten using `LATERAL JOIN`, which provides a more general mechanism for handling correlated subqueries. Unlike subqueries in `SELECT`, `LATERAL JOIN` allows additional computations, such as filtering and joining other tables, making it a more flexible approach.
In the example provided, since both methods rely on **similar logical steps**, their **query plans are almost identical**.
