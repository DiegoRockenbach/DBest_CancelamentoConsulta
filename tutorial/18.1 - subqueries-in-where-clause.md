## 18.1 - Subqueries in the WHERE Clause  

This section presents examples of **subqueries inside the WHERE clause**, one of the most common patterns in SQL. Subqueries in this context can take various forms, often incorporating additional SQL keywords such as **IN**, **EXISTS**, **ALL**, and **ANY**. These keywords influence how the subquery interacts with the main query, leading to different filtering behaviors.  

Beyond these standard constructs, subqueries in the WHERE clause can also appear in **boolean expressions** and **direct comparisons**, further expanding their versatility in query design. The following examples illustrate these different possibilities.
