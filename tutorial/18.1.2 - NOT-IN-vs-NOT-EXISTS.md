## Handling `NOT EXISTS` and `NOT IN`  

The first example retrieves movies that do not have cast member. The query below uses `NOT EXISTS`, where the subquery checks if a matching `movie_id` exists in the `movie_cast` table. If a match is not found, the movie is included in the result set.  

```sql
SELECT * FROM movie m  
WHERE NOT EXISTS (  
    SELECT 1 FROM movie_cast mc  
    WHERE m.movie_id = mc.movie_id  
);
```

Since the correlated condition uses **equality**, the query can also be expressed with `IN`, as shown below. The movie is considered relevant if its `movie_id` does not appear in a list of `movie_ids` associated with cast members.

```sql
SELECT * FROM movie  
WHERE movie_id NOT IN (  
    SELECT movie_id FROM movie_cast  
);
```

We present two primary ways to represent this query in **DBest**:  

- **Without Materialization (left approach):** The execution is fully pipelined, with the **Nested Loop Anti Join** directly searching for matching `movie_id`s in the `movie_cast` table.  
- **With Materialization  (right approach):** The **Hash** operator materializes `movie_cast` tuples in a **hash table**, enabling the **Nested Loop Anti Join** to perform efficient lookups.  
  - Alternatively, a **Hash Left Anti Join** can replace the **Nested Loop Anti Join + Hash** combination.

**Materialization** is preferable when there are many lookups since it avoids repeated index accesses. **Pipelined execution** is better for a small number of lookups, as it eliminates materialization overhead.  

Similar to the comparison between `IN` and `EXISTS`, **`NOT EXISTS` offers greater expressive power than `NOT IN`**.  
This is because `NOT EXISTS` supports a wider range of conditions beyond simple equality checks.  

## Impact of NULL values


The previous example showed a case where a query could be written using either `NOT IN` or `NOT EXISTS`,  
as the equality check allowed both formulations.  

However, this is not always possible.  

If the list returned by the `NOT IN` subquery contains `NULL` values,  
the query will return an **empty result set** due to SQL's **NULL semantics**.  


Consider the following SQL query, which retrieves movies whose **title is not a character name**. All qualifying titles are returned, **even if character names contain `NULL` values**.  

```sql
SELECT * FROM movie m
WHERE NOT EXISTS (  
    SELECT 1 FROM movie_cast mc WHERE m.title = mc.title
);
```

The diagrams below illustrate two ways to express this query in **DBest**:

#### Left Approach (Pipeline Solution):  
- Uses a **Nested Loop Anti Join** that queries `idx_c_name`, an index on `character_name`.  
- If no match is found, the movie is accepted as a valid tuple.  

#### Right Approach (Hash-Based Solution):  
- The **Hash** operator materializes `character_name` values into a hash table.  
- The **Nested Loop Anti Join** then queries the hash table for matches.  
- This approach is **more efficient** but **requires additional memory**.  

Now, consider the **`NOT IN`** version of the same query. This version **fails if `NULL` values exist** because SQL cannot determine whether a title is definitively **not** in the list. To avoid returning uncertain results, the query produces **no tuples**.

```sql
SELECT * FROM movie  
WHERE title NOT IN (  
    SELECT character_name FROM movie_cast
);
```

#### Left Approach (Pipeline Solution with OR Operator):  
- The **Nested Loop Anti Join** subtree includes an **OR** operator that evaluates two conditions:  
  1. If any `NULL` value exists in `character_name`, a flag is set.  
  2. If no `NULL` is found, a search is performed in `idx_c_name` to check if the current movie title appears as a `character_name`.  
- The **Limit** operator ensures only one tuple is materialized, avoiding unnecessary computations.  

#### Right Approach (Hash-Based Solution):  
- The **Nested Loop Anti Join** queries a **Hash** operator containing all `movie_cast` entries.  
- The filter applied over the hash table checks two conditions:  
  1. Whether `character_name` contains `NULL` values.  
  2. Whether `character_name` matches the current movie title.  
- If the `NULL` check passes, the **hash table lookup is skipped**, improving efficiency.  

### Key Differences Between `NOT IN` and `NOT EXISTS`:  
- **`NOT EXISTS`** handles `NULL` values gracefully and avoids unnecessary filtering.  
- **`NOT IN`** may fail when `NULL` values are present, leading to an **empty result set**.
