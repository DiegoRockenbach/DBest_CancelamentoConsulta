## Handling SQL Subqueries  

Complex SQL queries often include **subqueries**, which involve nested processing and correlated variables. DBest provides a set of operators to efficiently handle subqueries and capture their nuances.  

The following examples are provided:

 - [IN vs EXISTS](17.1%20-%20IN-vs-EXISTS.md).
 - [NOT IN vs NOT EXISTS](17.1%20-%20NOT-IN-vs-NOT-EXISTS.md).
