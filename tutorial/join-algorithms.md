# Join Algorithms and Their Variations

## 1. **Nested Loop Join**
The **Nested Loop Join** algorithm processes each tuple on the outer side and looks for matching tuples on the inner side. 

### **Key Points:**
- **Naive Strategy:** Scans all inner-side tuples for every outer-side tuple. This approach is highly inefficient.
- **Optimized Usage:**  
  - Place an operator on the inner side of the join to efficiently handle lookups.  
  - For example, use a data node indexed by the lookup column or a materialized operation that uses the lookup column as the search key.

## 2. **Hash Join**
The **Hash Join** algorithm processes the inner side once to build a hash table containing all inner-side tuples. The hash table uses the **lookup column(s)** as the key. For each outer-side tuple, the hash is queried to find matching inner-side tuples.

### **Key Points:**
- **Efficiency:** More efficient than the Nested Loop Join.
- **Memory Usage:** Requires memory to store the hash table.
- **Equivalent Process:** The Hash Join algorithm has the same effect as combining:
  - A **Nested Loop Join**.
  - A **Hash operator**.
  - A **Projection operator**.  

The image below illustrates this equivalence.

## 3. **Merge Join**
The **Merge Join** algorithm processes both sides of the join by traversing them in a forward-only direction, identifying matches as tuples are read.

### **Key Points:**
- **Prerequisite:** Both sides must be ordered by the join condition columns.
  - A **Sort operator** can be added to ensure the required order.
- **Pitfalls:** If tuples are not properly ordered, some matches may be missed.
- **Efficiency:** 
  - When tuples are already ordered, this is the **most efficient algorithm**:
    - Consumes no memory.
    - Scans each side only once.

By understanding these join algorithms, their trade-offs, and how to optimize their use, you can improve the performance of relational table queries.
