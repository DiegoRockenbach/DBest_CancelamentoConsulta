## Getting Started with DBest Operators

The **DBest** tool includes a wide range of operators that enable the creation of complex queries. To begin, itâ€™s recommended to start with the basic operators, which are foundational to relational algebra:  
- **Projection**  
- **Selection**  
- **Join**  
- **Aggregation**  

Some operators, like **joins**, have multiple variations. As a starting point, use the classic versions, such as the **Inner Join**.

### Example Query Trees
The example below illustrates two query trees that combine basic operators:
- **Join:** Combines `movie` and `movie_cast`.
- **Filter (Selection):** Filters rows based on the `year`.
- **Projection:** Projects only the `title` and `character_name` columns.

#### Key Difference:
- The **left tree** applies the filter operator after the join.  
- The **right tree** applies the filter operator before the join.

The position of the operators can significantly affect query performance.

### Tips for Beginners
1. **Start Small:** Use small data sources to avoid the tool hanging due to inefficient operator choices.
2. **Experiment:** Change the position of operators and observe how they impact the result set and query execution time.
3. **Learn by Doing:** Focus on understanding the purpose and behavior of each basic operator before moving on to advanced operators or creating indexes.
