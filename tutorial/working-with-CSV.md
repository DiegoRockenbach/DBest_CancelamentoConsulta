DBest supports CSV files. To open a CSV, use the proper menu item and choose a CSV file. Optionally, drag and drop a CSV file into the tree editor panel. A wizzard pop ups asking the user to inform parsing properties, such as delimiter and starting line. The tool displays a view of the CSV in a tabular fashion, with the column type for each column. The column type ca be changed to a more generic type, if needed. For instamnce, the INT type can be changed into the STRING type. A snapshot of the tool is displayed below:
