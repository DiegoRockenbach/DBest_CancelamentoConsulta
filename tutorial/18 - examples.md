# Expressing Queries in DBest  

This section presents examples of different types of queries that can be expressed using **DBest**. Some queries involve SQL representations, while others explore alternative request structures.  

DBest allows multiple ways to express the same query. We will demonstrate various approaches to highlight the flexibility in operator arrangements and query execution strategies.  

A special focus goes no subqueries. Complex SQL queries often include **subqueries**, which involve nested processing and correlated variables. DBest provides a set of operators to efficiently handle subqueries and capture their nuances.  

The following examples are provided:

 - [18.1 - Subqueries in the WHERE clause].
     - [18.1.1 - IN vs EXISTS](18.1%20-%20IN-vs-EXISTS.md).
     - [18.1.2 - NOT IN vs NOT EXISTS](18.2%20-%20NOT-IN-vs-NOT-EXISTS.md).
     - [18.1.3 - ANY-and-ALL](18.3%20-%20ANY-and-ALL.md).
     - [18.1.4 - Subqueries and direct comparisons](18.4%20-%20Subqueries-and-direct-comparisons.md).
     - [18.1.5 - Subqueries in boolean expressions](18.5%20-%20sub-queries-in-boolean-expressions.md). 
 - [18.2 - Subqueries in the FROM clause](18.6%20-%20subqueries-in-from-clause.md).
 - [18.3 - Subqueries in the SELECT clause](18.7%20-%20subqueries-in-select-clause.md).
 - [18.4 - ETL example](18.8%20-%20etl-example.md).
