# Expressing Queries in DBest  

This section presents examples of different types of queries that can be expressed using **DBest**. Some queries involve SQL representations, while others explore alternative request structures.  

DBest allows multiple ways to express the same query. We will demonstrate various approaches to highlight the flexibility in operator arrangements and query execution strategies.

## Handling SQL Subqueries  

Complex SQL queries often include **subqueries**, which involve nested processing and correlated variables. DBest provides a set of operators to efficiently handle subqueries and capture their nuances.  

The following examples are provided:

 - [IN vs EXISTS](17.1%20-%20IN-vs-EXISTS.md).
 - [NOT IN vs NOT EXISTS](17.2%20-%20NOT-IN-vs-NOT-EXISTS.md).
