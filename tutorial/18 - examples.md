# Expressing Queries in DBest  

This section presents various ways to express queries in **DBest**, including SQL representations and alternative request structures.  

DBest supports multiple ways to formulate the same query, offering flexibility in **operator arrangements** and **query execution strategies**.  

The examples provided focus on **subqueries**, a crucial component of complex SQL queries. Subqueries involve **nested processing** and often include **correlated variables**. DBest provides specialized operators to efficiently handle subqueries and capture their nuances.  

The following examples illustrate different use cases:  

- [18.1 - Subqueries in the WHERE clause](18.1%20-%20subqueries-in-where-clause.md)
  - [18.1.1 - IN vs EXISTS](18.1.1%20-%20IN-vs-EXISTS.md)  
  - [18.1.2 - NOT IN vs NOT EXISTS](18.1.2%20-%20NOT-IN-vs-NOT-EXISTS.md)  
  - [18.1.3 - ANY and ALL](18.1.3%20-%20ANY-and-ALL.md)  
  - [18.1.4 - Subqueries and direct comparisons](18.1.4%20-%20subqueries-and-direct-comparisons.md)  
  - [18.1.5 - Subqueries in boolean expressions](18.1.5%20-%20subqueries-in-boolean-expressions.md)  

- [18.2 - Subqueries in the FROM clause](18.2%20-%20subqueries-in-from-clause.md)
- [18.3 - Subqueries in the SELECT clause](18.3%20-%20subqueries-in-select-clause.md)
- [18.4 - ETL example](18.8%20-%20etl-example.md)
