## Using ANY and ALL in SQL Queries  

Besides `IN` and `EXISTS`, SQL also supports subqueries with `ANY` (or `SOME`) and `ALL` keywords.  

### Expressing `ANY` Queries Using `EXISTS`  

Queries using `ANY` can be rewritten using an `EXISTS`-based template.  
For example, the following query retrieves movies released before **any** movie titled *Casablanca*:  

```sql
SELECT * FROM movie  
WHERE release_year < ANY (SELECT release_year FROM movie WHERE title = 'Casablanca');  
```

This query can be expressed using `EXISTS` as follows:  

```sql
SELECT * FROM movie m1  
WHERE EXISTS (  
    SELECT 1 FROM movie m2  
    WHERE m2.title = 'Casablanca' AND m1.release_year < m2.release_year  
);  
```

Queries with other comparison types (e.g., `< ANY`, `= ANY`, `<> ANY`) can follow this template,  
adjusting the condition based on `release_year`.  



The `EXISTS`-based SQL query can be represented in DBest as follows:  

- *Casablanca* movies are **materialized**.  
- From this materialized list, the movies satisfying the filter condition  
  (`m1.release_year < m2.release_year`) are selected.  
- The **Nested Loop Semi Join** ensures that an outer tuple is **accepted**  
  if at least one relevant movie is found.

The query plan can be adapted for different comparison types by adjusting the filtering condition based on `release_year`.

### Expressing `ALL` Queries Using `NOT EXISTS`  

Queries using `ALL` can also be rewritten but require a different transformation.  
Consider the previous example, now using `ALL` instead of `ANY`:  

```sql
SELECT * FROM movie  
WHERE release_year < ALL (SELECT release_year FROM movie WHERE title = 'Casablanca');  
```

This can be rewritten using `NOT EXISTS` with a **reversed condition**:  

```sql
SELECT * FROM movie m1  
WHERE NOT EXISTS (  
    SELECT 1 FROM movie m2  
    WHERE m2.title = 'Casablanca'  
    AND (m1.release_year >= m2.release_year OR m1.release_year IS NULL OR m2.release_year IS NULL)  
);  
```

A movieâ€™s `release_year` being smaller than *all* Casablanca movies  
is the same as its `release_year` **not being greater than or equal** to **any** Casablanca movie.  

Comparing `NULL` values is necessary to **prevent NULLs from affecting the result**.  


The `NOT EXISTS`-based SQL query can be expressed in DBest as follows:  

- *Casablanca* movies are **materialized**.  
- From this materialized list, movies that **do not satisfy** the condition are identified:  
  - Movies that match the **reverse condition**.  
  - Movies containing **NULL** values in the condition columns.  
- The **Nested Loop Anti Join** ensures that an outer tuple is **ignored**  
  if any **irrelevant** movies are found.

The query plan can be adapted for different comparison types  
by adjusting the filtering condition based on `release_year`.


### Flexibility in Query Plan Construction  

The examples provided illustrate just one way to express these queries.  For instance, the last query could be optmized by:

- **Perform NULL checks once** and **materialize** the filtered tuples.  
- **Materialize the minimum release year** of *Casablanca* movies  
  to reduce memory usage further.  


DBest offers a **rich set of operators**, allowing queries to be formulated in multiple ways  
depending on performance goals and query optimization strategies.
