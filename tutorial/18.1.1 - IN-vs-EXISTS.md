## Handling `EXISTS` and `IN`  

The first example retrieves movies that have at least one cast member. The query below uses `EXISTS`, where the subquery checks if a matching `movie_id` exists in the `movie_cast` table. If a match is found, the movie is included in the result set.  

```sql
SELECT * FROM movie m  
WHERE EXISTS (  
    SELECT 1 FROM movie_cast mc  
    WHERE m.movie_id = mc.movie_id  
);
```

Since the correlated condition uses **equality**, the query can also be expressed with `IN`, as shown below. The movie is considered relevant if its `movie_id` appears in a list of `movie_ids` associated with cast members.

```sql
SELECT * FROM movie  
WHERE movie_id IN (  
    SELECT movie_id FROM movie_cast  
);
```

We present two primary ways to represent this query in **DBest**:  

- **Without Materialization (left approach):** The execution is fully pipelined, with the **Nested Loop Semi Join** directly searching for matching `movie_id`s in the `movie_cast` table.  
- **With Materialization  (right approach):** The **Hash** operator materializes `movie_cast` tuples in a **hash table**, enabling the **Nested Loop Semi Join** to perform efficient lookups.  
  - Alternatively, a **Hash Left Semi Join** can replace the **Nested Loop Semi Join + Hash** combination.

**Materialization** is preferable when there are many lookups since it avoids repeated index accesses. **Pipelined execution** is better for a small number of lookups, as it eliminates materialization overhead.  

Historically, **SQL optimizers** used **materialization** for `IN` subqueries and **pipelining** for `EXISTS` subqueries. However, modern optimizers can dynamically select the best execution plan, regardless of the SQL syntax used.  


## Finding Movies Released in the Same Year as *Casablanca*

The following SQL query retrieves movies released in the same year as *Casablanca*. Although it uses an `IN` subquery, an equivalent version with `EXISTS` is also possible.  


```sql
SELECT * FROM movie  
WHERE release_year IN (  
    SELECT release_year FROM movie  
    WHERE title = 'Casablanca'  
);the materi
```

One way to represent this query in **DBest** is by materializing the `movie_cast` tuples. Since the number of movies titled *Casablanca* is expected to be small, the cost of materialization remains low.  

Two different approaches to materialization are discussed:  

- **Materialized Operator (Left Approach):**  
  - Stores *Casablanca* movies in memory.  
  - Requires a **full scan** over the materialized tuples for each lookup, as indexed search is not supported.  

- **Hash Operator (Right Approach):**  
  - Stores *Casablanca* movies in a **hash table** for quick lookups.  
  - Given a movie, the **hash table** is queried directly to find matching tuples.  

Since the number of materialized tuples is small, both strategies should perform similarly.

## Finding Movies Released Before Casablanca  

The next query retrieves movies released before *Casablanca*. Unlike previous examples, this cannot be expressed using `IN` because the condition is a range comparison, not an equality check. However, `EXISTS` can handle it. This example demonstrates that `EXISTS` has greater expressive power than `IN`.   

```sql
SELECT * FROM movie2 m1  
WHERE EXISTS (  
    SELECT 1 FROM movie2 m2  
    WHERE m2.title = 'Casablanca'  
    AND m1.release_year < m2.release_year  
);
```


There are multiple ways to represent this query in **DBest**, one of which involves materialization:  

- **Materialize Operation:** Stores *Casablanca* movies in memory for efficient access.  
- **Filter Operator:** Evaluates whether each movie's `release_year` meets the specified condition.  
- **Nested Loop Semi Join:** Executes without an explicit condition, as the range check is performed by the internal filter.  

Since only a small number of tuples are materialized, the filtering step remains efficient. Interestingly, the **materialized approach** is applied to subqueries expressed with `EXISTS`. While `IN` subqueries are traditionally associated with materialization, this example demonstrates that materialization can also be beneficial for other types of subqueries.
