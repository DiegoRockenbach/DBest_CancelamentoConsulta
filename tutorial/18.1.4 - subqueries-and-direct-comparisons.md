## Subqueries and Direct Comparisons  

We have seen that some subqueries can be used with **relational operators** to return a **boolean value**,  such as `> ANY` or `= ALL`.  

The query below retrieves movies released **before any** movie titled *Casablanca*:  

```sql
SELECT * FROM movie  
WHERE release_year < ANY (SELECT release_year FROM movie WHERE title = 'Casablanca');  
```


It is also possible to **omit** the `ANY` or `ALL` keywords,  leaving only the **relational operator**.  

However, in this case, the subquery **must return a single value**  to allow direct comparison with the **outer query's** tuple.  
If the subquery returns multiple values, the query **fails with an error**.  

The following example demonstrates a **valid** direct comparison:  

```sql
SELECT * FROM movie  
WHERE release_year < (SELECT MIN(release_year) FROM movie WHERE title = 'Casablanca');  
```

Here, the outer query retrieves movies with a **release year earlier**  than the first recorded release year of *Casablanca*.  

The same query can be represented in **DBest** as follows:

As shown, SQL enforces strict **rules** to prevent ambiguity in query interpretation.  DBest, on the other hand, provides a **flexible query language**  that allows for **any logical arrangement of operators**,  as long as **operator arity** (nullary, unary, or binary) is respected.  

Beyond this, DBest does not impose restrictions on query structure.
