Some subqueries can be linked with relational operators to return a boolean flag (ex. > ANY, = ALL).

For instance, the query below returns movies released before any movie called 'Casablanca'.

SELECT * FROM movie
WHERE release_year < ANY (SELECT release_year FROM movie WHERE title = 'Casablanca')

It is also possible to remove the keywords, leaving only the relational operator.
HOwever, in this case,the subquerie necessarily must return a single tuple to enable a direct comparison with the tuple being processed by the outer query.  Queries that fail to satisfy this requirement end up with an error.

The query below shows a valid use of a subquery with a direct comparison. Now the outside tuple is valid if the year is less than the year when Casablanca was first released. 

SELECT * FROM movie
WHERE release_year < (SELECT MIN(release_year) FROM movie WHERE title = 'Casablanca')

In DBest, this query can be expressed as follows.

SQL inforces rules to prevent misinterpretation. 
DBest uses a query language that imposes no rules as to what can be expressed, except for the operators degree, with can be nullary, unary or binary. Other than that, any kind of arrangement is valid.
