In SQL, sub-queries can appear inside the SELECT clause of an outer query. This is useful when the purpose is computing independent results from the same pivot table. 

For instance, suppose we want to find, for each movie, its title and the number of cast members and crew members. This can be accomplished with the following query:

SELECT m.title, (SELECT count(*) FROM movie_cast mc WHERE m.movie_id = mc.movie_id), (SELECT count(*) FROM movie_crew mc WHERE m.movie_id = mc.movie_id)
FROM movie m;

Alternatively, the JOIN LATERAL could reach the same result
