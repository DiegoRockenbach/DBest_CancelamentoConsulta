## Running Queries

Once a query is built, you can execute it in the following ways:  
1. **Double-click** any node in the query tree.  
2. **Right-click** a selected node and choose the **"Run Query"** option from the menu.

### Querying Any Node
- **Internal Node**: Running a query on an internal node returns the intermediate result set generated up to that point in the query tree.  
- **Root Node**: To obtain the final result set, execute the query on the root node.

### Example: Root Node Execution
In the example below, the result set is generated by double-clicking the root projection node.

### Navigating the Result Set
- Use the **arrow buttons** to navigate through the result set:
  - **Forward**: Computes and retrieves new tuples.  
  - **Backward**: Retrieves previously stored tuples from an earlier forward navigation.
