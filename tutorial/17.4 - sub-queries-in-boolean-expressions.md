## Boolean Expressions with Subqueries in SQL  

In SQL, some subqueries evaluate to **true** or **false**, such as those used with `IN` and `EXISTS`.  
Other subqueries also return a boolean result when combined with a **comparison operator**,  
such as `> ANY` or `= ALL`.  



Since these subqueries produce boolean values, they can be used as **terms**  in complex logical expressions.  

For example, the following query retrieves movies that have either **cast members** or **production members**:  

```sql
SELECT * FROM movie  
WHERE movie_id IN (SELECT movie_id FROM movie_cast)  
OR movie_id IN (SELECT movie_id FROM movie_crew);  
```

DBest provides a **set of boolean expression operators** that allow subqueries to be combined using logical operators.  

For instance, the query above can be represented in DBest as follows:  

*(Insert image here.)*  

The **OR operator** takes two **subtrees** as input,  where each subtree represents a **subquery**.  

Logical operators in DBest are **binary**, meaning more complex conditions require **nesting** multiple logical operators.  For example, when expressing multiple disjoint conditions,  
the query structure forms a **binary tree**,  where **internal nodes** are OR operators.
